# snowshoe
Snowshoe has three characteristic features.
## multipurpose syntax
Snowshoe has two flow control expressions; if and loop.
I mostly work on machine language, which has only one of those; jump instruction.
Of course, for most purposes, we don't want to use what is called goto in assembly language.
So I searched for the minimum yet not spaghetti-causing expressions.

# side return
Functions in snowshoe can take multiple arguments.
