# Snowshoe
Snowshoe is a programming language somewhere between low and middle level.
It has three characteristic features.
## Multipurpose Syntax
Snowshoe has only two flow control expressions; if and loop.
These are effective enough to replace others.
## Side Return
Functions in Snowshoe can give several side return value besides the main one.
These parallel results from functions removed any exception-processing expression.
## One-layer Import
You can import definitions from a source file to another.
However, Snowshoe does not recognize any definitions imported indirectly.
Also, most words are imported with a prefix.
These keep Snowshoe namespaces clean.
